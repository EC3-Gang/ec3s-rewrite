			HCI EC&sup3; stands for the Electronics Communications and Computing Club
			(quite a mouthful, yes I know) and is a CCA in Hwa Chong Institution. It
			serves as the High School counterpart of the Infocomm and Robotics Society
			(IRS) in the College section, comprising of around 30 members from
			Secondary 1 to 4. The club is dedicated to nurturing students' interest in
			infocomm and computing, and provides a platform for members to explore
			their interests in these areas.
